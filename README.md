# Weather App

This is a weather app that fetches weather data from the OpenWeather API and supports querying places via the TomTom API. The app allows users to search for a city, view its weather conditions, and toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit units. Users can also view todayâ€™s five-hour forecast and a five-day forecast.
